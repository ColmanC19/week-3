# _Beep-Boop_

### Week 3 project for Epicodus working on Arrays and Looping.  10/7/19

###  By Colman Currie



# Third take home project I completed for Epicodus.

This is a simple survey I made for class at Epicodus. I used html, css, javascript, bootstrap and jquery to make it. It is a simple survey using 5 questions with four possible answers for each one. User fills it out and hits submit to find out what programming language they should start learning!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop._
* _Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"_
* _If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser._

## Specs:
## 1)The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
      User input 4, expected outcome would be "0,1,2,3,4"
## 2) Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
      User input 3, expected outcome "0,1,2,"I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.""
## 3) Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
      User input 3, expected outcome "0,1,Boop,I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
## 4) Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
      User input 1, expected outcome "0,Beep.
## These specs are written in order of importance. See below for examples on what to expect for an outcome
### The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
### The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."


_I believe you can run this on any system. I did download the most recent version of bootstrap and jquery_



_No known bugs at this point_



_If you run into any issues, or want any additional information please contact me at curriecolman@gmail.com._



I used html, css, javascript, bootstrap (* Bootstrap v3.3.7 (http://getbootstrap.com)) and jquery (jQuery JavaScript Library v3.4.1 https://jquery.com/).
